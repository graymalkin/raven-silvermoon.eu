**Present**: Belar, Kalfrice, Endarion

1. The officers went over the raider roster looking hard at the requested roles and how we would stitch together a raid team. We were not able to give everyone what they requested, but we have a starting raid team. Flexibility, as before, is very important. Personally, I have given up my tank role for the good of the raid team and must DPS.

2. The old website has now been lost. The new website has salvaged some of the old content, especially the Raven Cookbook!!

3. We have our first draft at a Discord application process. George has tested it. We rejected him. We can expect to develop it as we go on.

4. Please research the raid bosses to minimise surprises and save raid time. Thank-you. (edited)

5. George is interested in recruitment, if you have any ideas or suggestions, please take them to him
