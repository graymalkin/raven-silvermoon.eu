Today Endarion agreed to become an officer partly because he will now have the ability to demote or Kick Stev
Mostly it's because he has been with us for a good long time and has always been willing to help others and the guild.
We agreed that he is allowed to go fishing in the summer, and sometimes in the winter
Sadly, he has not agreed that druids are not food...
