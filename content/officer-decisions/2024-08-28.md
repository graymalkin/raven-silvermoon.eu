**Present**: Belar, Endarion, Kalfrice

 - Raiding: we have 25 raiders that have expressed their wish to raid this expansion but only one as MT. We will invite Cronus to act as second tank unless someone else expresses a strong desire and can commit.
 - Gearing: we are looking for a gear level of **571** to start raiding with cheap enchants and gems and such. Get these things done but no need to break your banks ty.
 - First raid: 11th September WooHoo WE ARE BACK!
