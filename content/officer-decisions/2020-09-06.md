**Present**: Belar, Neffetiti, Endarion, Ilanas, Evanne

**Topic discussed**: Tanks for Shadowlands

After a good discussion which covered all aspects of this topic, our tanks for Shadowlands will be Ren, Neffetiti and Huamanu.
Backups will be Nalya and Asmodeusz as long as they promise not to make our regular tanks look bad....

Belar will main Baell as we seem to have a shortage of DKs and class balance is more important with the restoration of raid-relevant CDs.
