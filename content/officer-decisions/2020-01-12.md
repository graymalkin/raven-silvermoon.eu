**Present**: Belar, Kess, Illanas, Endarion

We had a wide-ranging discussion around raiding and the composition of the raid team.
Sharion has been set at Elder and Neffe has been promoted to officer
This also marks the first time since the guild was formed that the officers have had more ladies than gentlemen!!!

I have been assured that the officer meetings will not turn to discussing girl-stuff!
