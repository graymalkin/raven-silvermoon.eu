**Present**: Belar, Marianne, Endarion, Illanas, Neffe

**Tactics in raids**
Too many voices or too many tactical choices lead to a confused raid.
Please allow trhe RL to set out the tactics he wishes to use without interruption.
He will then ask for comments, thanks

**Webmeister**
Alaranna has highly developed skills around website design and maintenance.
We will ask him if he is willing to be our webmeister for no pay at all!

**Streaming of raids**
There is Euro law on this topic around consent.
Anyone streaming raids should be sure that they have the explicit consent of all raiders to do so
(Yes that means that there are some who are unsure about being streamed)

**Mini-meets**
The officers will meet briefly for a chat prior to Sunday raids each week

**Social events**
There are two more social events similar to "Who killed Stev" (or who might like to..form a line) in advanced planning, keep listening
