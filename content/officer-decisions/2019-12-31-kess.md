Kess and I talked at some length last night and she offered to step up to officer again if I thought that would help.
I accepted with gratitude.

As I posted in the notes from the officer meeting, RL concerns have hit our officers like a punch in the face.
Kess's return will strengthen us and help us to get past these issues.

Notably the absence of some raiders who have vanished into WoW Classic leaving the raid team short-handed.
These and other matters are being discussed
More soon
