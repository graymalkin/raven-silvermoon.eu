**Present**: Belar, Alaranna, Kessina, Anazoria, Evodius

1. **Promotions/Demotions**

 - Nimgul (Fierydeath) and Ellendiel requested demotion to social
 - Haeman demoted to social for non-attendance of raids
 - Sheepies and Aeeon promoted to Core Raider
 - Attendance checks (re the future) for Raptorspy and Pithlet

2. **M+ guild communications via Discord**
There is a lot of functionality in Discord that we don't use that might help us organising M+ runs
We would have asked Floes to perhaps assist but, sadly, he has now left
We are looking for someone with more than average knowledge of Discord to help

3. **Raidleading organisation**
Recently the raid organisers omitted to get the best advice from the tactical raidleader regarding raid composition
We will try to make sure this is improved in future

4. **Tanks**
Evodius confirmed that he will not be tanking for us this expansion
Later in the meeting he admitted that he has been struggling to find his place in the game since his break earlier last year
This eventually lead to him deciding to leave Raven, at least while he finds out what the game can offer him for the future.
I am sure that you will all join me in thanking him for his extensive help and effort in the past (remember the memes and the epic videos as well as his unique raidleading style and colourful language) A return is not ruled out but likely not in the near future.
We are looking for a backup tank from our raid team, enquiries to the officers

5. **Healers**
You might have noticed that we have a lot of resto druids.
We need a varied team of healers to make use of their different talents so we will be talking to our raiders to ask how we might achieve this

6. **Raid performance**
As we have stated many times in the past, our policy is inclusion, not exclusion, and we will only reduce raid numbers to improve performance where the RL thinks this is absolutely necessary for specific bosses that are giving us grief

7. **Social events**
We are exploring other event options and welcome assistance from the guild members, of whatever rank
Bring us your ideas, we will see if they float

8. **Officers**
We discussed officers, with particular reference to Evo and Anazoria
Initially, Anazoria wished to be demoted and Evodius felt that he needed to leave as he had no place at present
Later, Anazoria posted on the forums and left as well.
We note that Vyx and Floes have joined them and they can all be found in a small (possibly placeholder) guild
There was no fight or drama and we wish them well
