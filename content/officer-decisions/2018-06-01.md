Hello Ravens,

With the new expension on the horizon we had a look at our ranks and felt we could shuffle a few things round.
So here are the changes that will happen shortly.

| **Current Ranks** |       | New Ranks          |
|:------------------|:-----:|:-------------------|
| Social            |  -->  | Guild Alt          |
| Guild Alt         |  -->  | Social             |
| Killer            |  -->  | Killer             |
| Raider Trial      |  -->  | Trial Raider       |
| Core Raider       |  -->  | Elder              |
| Raid Corpse       |  -->  | Wipe Specialist    |
| Raid Champion     |  -->  | Core Raider        |
| Exalted Alts      |  -->  | Exalted Alts       |
| Senior Staff      |  -->  | Senior Staff       |
| GM                |  -->  | GM                 |

Elder rank is effectively a non raider rank, of long standing members to give a bit more Gbank access, and reward those who stick with us and make Raven what it is today 
To get promoted to Elder and stay there:
6 Months in the guild, and no more than 4 weeks not logging in.

When we swap all the ranks over, if you have been overlooked, don't be alarmed and just point it out to an officer, we have 300-ish characters to sort out and we are humans!

Because of the guild bank access associated with the ranks, an authenticator would be needed for:

 - Elder
 - Wipe Specialist
 - Core Raider
 - Exalted Alts
 - Senior Staff
 - GM

Happy Wow-ing everyone
