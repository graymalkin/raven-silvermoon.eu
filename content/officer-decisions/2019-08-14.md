Recent discussions have lead to a change which we want you all to be aware of.

*Old rule*:
You can have as many alts in the guild as you like but your main must be here.
The main character for a raider, will be the character that generally raids to the highest level
If you leave the guild with your main, all alts must be removed
<!--more-->

*New rule*:
You can join the guild with an alt as long as the alt gets played
We will continue to remove unplayed alts after 3 months offline (Blizz says 3 months after 2 months and 1 day)
We will remove mains after 4 months offline (Blizz says 4 months after 3 months and 1 day)
Being kicked for inactivity is not a problem when you start to play again, readmission is normally automatic

This change drops another of our oldest rules and goes along with Blizzards developments around assisting socialisation and communication in-game.

Any questions, please ask the officers
