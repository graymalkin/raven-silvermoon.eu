<h1 style="font-size:200%">Welcome to the Raven website!</h1>

Raven is a social raiding guild on the Silvermoon EU server, Alliance side. We have been around since 2005. Our primary goal is to get the 'Ahead of the Curve' achievement every single raid tier, while having lots of fun.

Raiding happens on 2 nights a week, **Wednesday** and **Sunday**, **from 20:00 until 23:00** server time. Our community is mature and we prefer our members to be 18+, since we don't wish to be held responsible for the corruption of impressionable minds...

There's a lot more activity in our guild than just two raids a week, however. If you are an altoholic, a Mythic+ junkie, an achievement hunter, a pet battle afficionado, an auction house mogul, a druid cook, a collector of either beautiful or terrifying transmog sets... you will find like-minded friends in Raven. In between raid tiers, we might even dip our toes in other games. We are always welcoming new members.

Check us out on wowprogress or raider.io. If you wish to join Raven, or would like some more information, feel free to have a look around on our website. If you have any questions please have a chat with our GM, Belar (Baell#2894), or any of the guild officers: Ev√†nne, Endarion, Nullfactor or Kalfrice.

One more thing... You must be prepared to leave your sanity at the door.
