Raven is an Alliance Guild on the Silvermoon EU server. We are a social Raiding Guild with emphasis on progressing through all major content.
Raven is a long standing guild, established in 2005, our aim is to clear each Heroic tier, while having a good time!
 
We will strive to be one of the most upstanding casual and welcoming Guilds on Silvermoon. We pride ourselves on our social culture and always welcome new members. Lastly we have a mature community and we prefer our members to be 18+.
