On the 14th of December, a group of thirsty gnome tourists discovered the body of the infamous paladin Uldstev, who was brutally murdered in front of the Blue Recluse Inn in Stormwind.

A group of brave adventurers set out to investigate who committed this heinous crime.

After a long pursuit, which took us through all of Azeroth, the culprit has been discovered! The fiendish rogue is still on the run, but SI:7 is following his tracks. Meanwhile, caution is advised with free food and drink samples sent by mail.
