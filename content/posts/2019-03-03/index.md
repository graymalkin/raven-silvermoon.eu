On Sunday 3 March, a crack commando unit was sent to Zuldazar by the Alliance to slay the Zandalari King and collect Epics. These men and women promptly escaped from a maximum security Dazar'Alor to the Boralus Underground. Today, still wanted by the Horde Warchief they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The Raid-Team.....
